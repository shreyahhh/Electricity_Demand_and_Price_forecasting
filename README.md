Model	MAE (Test Set)
LSTM	0.015
XGBoost	0.016
LSTM-Attention	0.015


This project applies advanced machine learning and deep learning models to forecast electricity demand and prices using time series data. The following models were implemented and evaluated:

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Captures temporal dependencies and patterns in sequential data.

XGBoost: A robust ensemble learning method based on gradient boosting, effective for tabular and time series data.

Hybrid LSTM-Attention: Enhances the LSTM model by allowing the network to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, improving forecasting accuracy.

All models demonstrated strong predictive performance. The LSTM and Hybrid LSTM-Attention models achieved the lowest MAE of 0.015, closely followed by XGBoost at 0.016. These results highlight the effectiveness of both deep learning and ensemble approaches for electricity demand and price forecasting.
